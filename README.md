# libmapper-experiments

I installed libmapper with `homebrew install libmapper`

this is the official documentation for libmapper python bindings: [libmapper/bindings/python at main · libmapper/libmapper](https://github.com/libmapper/libmapper/tree/main/bindings/python) 


`pip install libmapper` worked in Python 3.9 and didn't work in Python 3.11


this is the webmapper release: [Release v2.3 · libmapper/webmapper](https://github.com/libmapper/webmapper/releases/tag/2.3). I used the macosx version, downloaded and called `webmapper` in the terminal.
